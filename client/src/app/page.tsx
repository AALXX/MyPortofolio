                    Hello, world! My name is Serban Alexandru, and I am an indie software developer and tech enthusiast with a passion for creating innovative digital things. You can find me either creating web
                    applications or fidgeting with low-level programming. I love solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of my technology knowledge.

                    My love for coding began with video gamesâ€”what started as a fascination with interactive experiences soon led me to dive into game development, graphics programming, and rendering pipelines. Along the
                    way, I dipped my feet into web development, where I fell in love, focusing on fast, responsive, and intuitive applications. My interest in systems programming pushed me to experiment with Assembly and
                    C++, even attempting to build my own OS. More recently, AI and machine learning have captured my attention, and while I'm still learning, I'm excited about the endless possibilities they offer.

                    In a field that evolves rapidly, I believe that adaptability and continuous learning are key to staying ahead. I see every challenge as an opportunity to grow, whether it's mastering a new programming
                    language, exploring the latest frameworks, or diving into academic research. Above all, I value clean, efficient code, user-focused design, and the power of technology to create meaningful and
                    impactful experiences. My goal is to keep pushing myself, sharing and gaining knowledge, and building projects that make a difference.
